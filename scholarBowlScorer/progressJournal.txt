February 25-26: ~5 hours - Researched GUI development in Java using Swing.  I learned the basics of using layout managers as well as their behavior as containers, as well as some basic methods included in the WindowBuilder and Swing libraries.  The starting screen for the utility was created where users can set the names of the players and teams, at least visually.

February 27 ~2 hours - Started programming the buttons to accept a user input and that would set the button text to the input - this is currently useless but later I'll implement a spreadsheet that takes from the button's text, or the variable containing it.  I'm having trouble with creating a separate method that calls the prompt, so for now I'll just stick to doing it all locally.

February 28 ~4 hours - Added additional screens for setting up match details and the GUI that is to be displayed during the game for selecting the player that answered, as well as the question number.  As of now, the variables are useless in scoring - I'm trying to work out how Swing works and learn about designing the UI as well as how some of the event handlers work.  I had some issues with variables being initialized - turns out that line orders are important.  Creating a dialog prompt was somewhat tricky as well, as I didn't know that they (I think) returned an int whereas in order to create the conditional for checking which option was selected I would need to use JOptionPane.YES_OPTION.  I will be showing the UI as it is currently to the Scholar Bowl coach and get his input on it in the near future.
